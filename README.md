## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

Download the apk file from the [releases](https://github.com/anonfaded/fadeboard/releases/tag/v2.0).

## ‚è¨ Install

Right now there isn't any launcher so you won't see any icon of the app on your homescreen, you just need to enable the keyboard from the `keyboard settings` of your device. The process is same for all android devices, titles or locations might vary.

1. Open the `settings` of your device.
2. Go to `Language and keyboard`.
(or open the search bar and type `keyboard`)

3. Go to `Keyboard list and default`. 
4. You will see `FadeBoard`, enable that and now you can switch to this and the default keyboard anytime from the switch keyboard button.

## ‚ùì Use cases 

You might be wondering the purpose of this weird keyboard?
Well its very handy in:

**Commenting**
- Whenever we comment something on social media apps, they filter out some words and many times we face temporary ban, this is where FadeBoard will save you!
Whenever you face the fem!n!sts you will must need this board lol.

**Strong Passwords**
- This will be your personal password manager type of keyboard which will auto make strong passwords while you remember the simple english, for example if we have a password `thisismysecretpassword`, you type and remember the same but in output it will become `th!$!$my$3cr3tpa$$w0rd`, see the magicüé©. Also not everyone will be having this keyboard so if someone knows or heard your password, they won't remember the complex password.

Well you can share more ideas of where else it can be used :)
