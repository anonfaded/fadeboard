## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

Download the apk file from the [releases](https://github.com/anonfaded/fadeboard/releases/tag/v2.0).

## ‚ùì Install

Right now there isn't any launcher so you won't see any icon of the app on your homescreen, you just need to enable the keyboard from the `keyboard settings` of your device. The process is same for all android devices, titles or locations might vary.

1. Open the `settings` of your device.
2. Go to `Language and keyboard`.
(or open the search bar and type `keyboard`)
